# âœ… Frontend Dependency Issue - FIXED

## Problem
The frontend was failing to start due to corrupted/missing dependencies in `workbox-build` package.

## Solution Applied
âœ… Completely cleaned and reinstalled all client dependencies:
- Removed `node_modules` directory
- Removed `package-lock.json`
- Fresh `npm install` to rebuild all dependencies correctly

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **FIXED** - All frontend dependencies are now properly installed and ready to use.

## Next Steps
Your system is now ready to run:

```bash
node start-simple.js
```

Both backend and frontend should start successfully now!
