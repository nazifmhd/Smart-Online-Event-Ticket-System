The Smart Event Ticket Booking System is fully functional and ready to use.

## 🛠️ How to Start the System

### Option 1: Using Memory Database (Recommended for Testing)

```
This uses an in-memory MongoDB database - perfect for testing and development.

### Option 2: Using Local MongoDB
```bash
node start-system-fixed.js
```
This requires MongoDB to be installed locally.

### Option 3: Manual Start
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd client
npm start
```
